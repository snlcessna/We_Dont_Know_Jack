      <p>The object of We Don't Know Jack is to be the first to guess the correct answer.
The player with the highest score will win.<br><br>
      This is a 2-player game.<br><br>
      The 'A' Key is applied to player 1. The 'L' key is applied to player 2.<br><br>
      When you begin the game you will need to enter your name and choose whether you'd
like to play a long or short game. The short game has 5 questions. The long game has
11 questions.<br><br>
      You and your opponent may buzz in by pressing the 'A' key and 'L' key. The quicker
you are to draw, the more likely you are to score points.<br><br>
The player that buzzes in first will have his or her name backlit with an ethereal glow.<br><br>
      WARNING: If you guess wrong, you will lose points. Also, the game will not advance to
a new round until someone gets the question correct.</p>
