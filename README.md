# We_Dont_Know_Jack

- We Don't Know Jack is a two-player game where players answer trivia questions. The game can be played in a short, 5 question game; or, a longer, 11 question contest.

- Players begin the game by selecting a category. After the question is displayed, the first player to buzz in will get a chance to answer. The player who buzzes in first will be reflected by a illuminated box around their username and score data.

- A correct answer will earn the player a nice audible chime sound and 1000 points.

- A wrong answer will earn you a nasty buzzer sound and a 500 point deduction. Also, anyone watching you will point and laugh.

- Note: The game will NOT continue until the question is answered correctly. No one hides from the buzzer!

- Remember to have fun! And take solace in the fact that "We Don't Know Jack" either.
